[I]BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices[/I] avoids using "[FONT="Courier New"]fastboot oem unlock[/FONT]", with its associated "userdata" wipe. When fastboot unlocks it updates a lock status flag, stored on a partition of your device's internal storage. Device partitions, positions and state values (locked/unlocked) are as follows:

[LIST]
[*]On the Galaxy Nexus, the bootloader uses position [FONT="Courier New"]0x000007C[/FONT] of the "param" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT].
[*]On the Nexus 10, the bootloader uses position [FONT="Courier New"]0x0000224[/FONT] of the "param" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT].
[*]On the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5, the bootloaders use position [FONT="Courier New"]0x0004010[/FONT] of the "misc" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT]. The Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 have a "Tamper" flag, at position [FONT="Courier New"]0x0004014[/FONT] of the "misc" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT] (untampered/tampered).
[*]On the Nexus 7 (2013), the bootloader uses position [FONT="Courier New"]0x04FFC00[/FONT] of the "aboot" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]02[/FONT].
[*]On the OnePlus One and OnePlus X, the bootloaders use position [FONT="Courier New"]0x000FFE10[/FONT] of the "aboot" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT]. The OnePlus One and OnePlus X have a "Tamper" flag, at position [FONT="Courier New"]0x000FFE14[/FONT] of the "aboot" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT] (untampered/tampered).
[*]On the OnePlus 2, the bootloader uses position [FONT="Courier New"]0x00000010[/FONT] of the "devinfo" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT]. The OnePlus 2 has a "Tamper" flag, at position [FONT="Courier New"]0x00000014[/FONT] of the "devinfo" partition, stored as [FONT="Courier New"]00[/FONT] / [FONT="Courier New"]01[/FONT] (untampered/tampered).
[/LIST]

On devices with Tamper flag locations listed above, [I]BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices[/I] can also set and clear this flag. You can also view this flag using "[FONT="Courier New"]fastboot oem device-info[/FONT]".

[I]BootUnlocker[/I] uses root privileges to write to to the appropriate location directly, bypassing fastboot. This allows you to lock and unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your "userdata" partition.
